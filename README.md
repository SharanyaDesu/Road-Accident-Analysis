This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard for analyzing road accidents using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of road accidents through dynamic visualizations and data analysis.

The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

**Accident_Index:** Unique identifier for each accident

**Accident Date:** Date of the accident

**Day_of_Week:** Day of the week when the accident occurred

**Junction_Control:** Type of control at the junction where the accident occurred

**Junction_Detail:** Detailed description of the junction

**Accident_Severity:** Severity of the accident

**Latitude:** Latitude of the accident location

**Light_Conditions:** Light conditions at the time of the accident

**Local_Authority_(District):** District authority responsible for the area

**Carriageway_Hazards:** Hazards present on the carriageway

**Longitude:** Longitude of the accident location

**Number_of_Casualties:** Number of casualties involved

**Number_of_Vehicles:** Number of vehicles involved

**Police_Force:** Police force attending the accident

**Road_Surface_Conditions:** Conditions of the road surface

**Road_Type:** Type of road where the accident occurred

**Speed_limit:** Speed limit at the accident location

**Time:** Time of the accident

**Urban_or_Rural_Area:** Classification of the area as urban or rural

**Weather_Conditions:** Weather conditions at the time of the accident

**Vehicle_Type:** Type of vehicle involved




**Steps Followed:**
Requirement Gathering: Identified the project goals and requirements from stakeholders.

Stakeholders in Project: Involved relevant stakeholders to ensure the dashboard meets their needs.

Raw Data Overview: Reviewed the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

Connecting Data with Power BI: Imported and connected the dataset to Power BI for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data to handle missing values and incorrect data types.

Data Processing: Transformed and prepared the data for analysis.

Data Modeling (DAX): Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in Power BI to create calculated columns and measures for deeper insights.

Background Design: Designed the layout and visual elements of the dashboard for effective presentation.

Data Visualization: Created various visualizations including donut charts, maps, stacked bar charts, cards, and line charts to represent the data insights.

Reports: Compiled the visualizations into comprehensive reports for easy interpretation and decision-making.




**Visualization Types:**
Donut Charts: Used to display proportions and distributions of accident severity and types.

Maps: Visualized geographical distribution of accidents and identified high-risk areas.

Stacked Bar Charts: Showed the comparison of accidents across different categories such as vehicle types and weather conditions.

Cards: Provided key metrics like total number of casualties and accidents.

Line Charts: Displayed trends and patterns over time, such as the number of accidents by month.


The dashboard allows users to interact with the data, filter based on various parameters, and gain valuable insights into road accidents, ultimately aiding in understanding and improving road safety.
